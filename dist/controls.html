    <h1>Controls</h1>
    <div style=" width: 840px;">
        <img src="controls/1.png"/><br/>
        <p>You start with <b>3 lives</b>, you can see them in the upper right corner of the screen. If the guard sees you, you will lose one.</p><br/><br/>
        <img src="controls/2.png"/><br/>
        <p>If you hover over an object with your mouse, you can see a <b>description text</b> in the top middle.</p><br/><br/>
        <img src="controls/3.png"/><br/>
        <p>In the upper left corner of the screen you can see a <b>turn indicator</b>, which shows you how many actions you or the guard can take until <b>the other one can start its turn</b>. Keep in mind that some actions take longer than others.</p><br/><br/>
        <img src="controls/4.png"/><br/>
        <p>If an object (like the right room in this case) is <b>glowing yellow</b>, you can interact with it by clicking on it. By using your <b>mouse wheel</b>, you can adjust the zoom to see more of your surroundings.</p><br/><br/>
        <img src="controls/5.png"/><br/>
        <p>If you enter a room with lasers, <b>the guard will be alerted</b> and will move to your position. To <b>prevent this from happening</b>, you can <b>click on the laser rays</b> to enter the room cautiously.</p><br/><br/>
        <img src="controls/6.png"/><br/>
        <p>In the upper right corner of this room you can see a <b>safe</b>. Crack it via <b>clicking on the lock</b> and you will find some treasures.</p><br/><br/>
        <img src="controls/7.png"/><br/>
        <p>If you click on the lock on the safe door, a <b>minigame</b> will appear. Here you can rotate the lock by clicking the ±1 and ±5 buttons. If you're on the right spot, <b>the corresponding red lamp will change to yellow</b>. If you turn in the other direction now, <b>the first lock part will unlock</b> and the lamp will change to green. If you <b>overshoot</b> the right point, the lock will reset its state and you have to <b>start again</b>. If all lock parts are set up right, click the open button to <b>open the safe</b>.</p><br/><br/>
        <img src="controls/10.png"/><br/>
        <p>In the upper right corner of this room you can see a <b>camera</b> and a <b>monitor</b>. You can look at the monitor to <b>reveal all other camera rooms</b>. If the <b>guard is in another camera room</b> while you are in one, he will <b>trigger an alarm</b> in your room.</p>
        <img src="controls/8.png"/><br/>
        <p>When the guard is <b>alerted</b>, he will <b>move faster</b> for a while. He will get alerted through item effects, or through room alarms. When a room alarm is active, the guard will move there as quickly as possible.</p><br/><br/>
        <img src="controls/9.png"/><br/>
        <p>You can <b>drop items from your inventory</b> by clicking on them (when you regret taking them).</p><br/><br/>
